## Introduction

In this article, we will compare some of popular tools used for web testing automation. 

We will focus on tools having those characteristics:
- **open-source** tools
- executable on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) platform
- with implementation possible in TypeScript 
- **mature** and quiet popular

We will begin with 5 tools (in alphabetical order): 

1. [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io/)                                       
2. [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org)                              
3. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)                                  
4. [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
5. [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)

> Indeed, in this article, and to be fair in the comparison, we will take JavaScript/TypeScript versions of Playwright and Selenium.

## Popularity of the 5 tools

TL;DR:
- **Cypress** is today the **most popular tool**, among the 5
- **Playwright** is gradually **gaining popularity** (see [trends on NPM/GitHub/Google "fame" indicators](./300-web-app-testing-tools-benchmark-popularity.md))
- **Selenium** remains popular, but has **serious competitors**
- WebdriverIO is in the 4th position 
- Nightwatch seems to be less popular than the 4 others

To have an overview of "popularity" of each tool, we will use indicators retrieved on NPM, GitHub and Google.

See more details in ["popularity" sub-page](./300-web-app-testing-tools-benchmark-popularity.md).

The table below gives you an overview of the relative popularity of these 5 tools, with a few indicators and their evolution:
