See more details in ["popularity" sub-page](./300-web-app-testing-tools-benchmark-popularity.md).
## Introduction

In this article, we will compare some of popular tools used for web testing automation. 

We will focus on tools having those characteristics:
- **open-source** tools
- executable on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) platform
- with implementation possible in TypeScript 
- **mature** and quiet popular

We will begin with 4 tools (in alphabetical order): 

1. [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io/)                                       
2. [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org)                              
3. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)                                  
4. [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)

> Indeed, in this article, and to be fair in the comparison, we will take JavaScript/TypeScript versions of Playwright and Selenium.

We will use our code hosted on [`testndev/web-app-testing-tools-benchmark`](https://github.com/testndev/web-app-testing-tools-benchmark/) repository for our technical benchmark.
