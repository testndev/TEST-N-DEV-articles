## Introduction

In this article, I will compare some of **popular tools** used...
- *in* software development of web applications, 
- *for* testing purposes, 
- *in order* to automaticaly control your web application in a browser and check its behaviour.

I will try to be as objective as possible. It is not a "versus" article, not a "click bait" post, but a comparison of the characteristics, features and performance of each tool.

### selection of tools
We will focus on tools having those characteristics:
- **open-source** tools
- executable on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) platform
- with possible implementation in TypeScript 
- and **mature** and quiet popular

We selected the following 5 tools: 

1. [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io/)                                       
2. [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org)                              
3. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)                                  
4. [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) (+ a JavaScript testing framework)
5. [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)

In this article, and to be fair in the comparison, we will take JavaScript/TypeScript versions of Playwright and Selenium.

## Quick presentation of the compared tools

In the table below, the official quick presentations of the 5 tools, as given on their respective websites:

## Popularity of the 5 tools

TL;DR:
- **Cypress** is today the **most popular tool**, among the 5
- **Playwright** is gradually **gaining popularity** (see [trends on NPM/GitHub/Google "fame" indicators](./300-web-app-testing-tools-benchmark-popularity.html))
- **Selenium** remains popular, but has **serious competitors**
- WebdriverIO is in the 4th position 
- Nightwatch seems to be less popular than the 4 others

To have an overview of "popularity" of each tool, we will use indicators retrieved on NPM, GitHub and Google.

See more details in ["popularity" sub-page](./300-web-app-testing-tools-benchmark-popularity.html).

The table below gives you an overview of the relative popularity of these 5 tools, with a few indicators and their evolution:
