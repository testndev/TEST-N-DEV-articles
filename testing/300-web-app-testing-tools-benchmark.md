## Introduction

In this article, we will compare some of popular tools used for web testing automation. We will focus on **open-source** tools, tools available in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) / TypeScript implementations.

We will begin with 4 tools: 
- [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io/)
- *vs* [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org) 
- *vs* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) 
- *vs* [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)

> Indeed, in this article, and to be fair in the comparison, we will take JavaScript/TypeScript versions of Playwright and Selenium.

We will use our code hosted on [`testndev/web-app-testing-tools-benchmark`](https://github.com/testndev/web-app-testing-tools-benchmark/) repository for our technical benchmark.

## Quick comparison of the 4 compared tools

### Trend on the NPM packages

From [npm trends](https://npmtrends.com/cypress-vs-nightwatch-vs-playwright-vs-selenium-webdriver), we can see the popularity of each tool, by number of weekly downloads from NPM. 

#### last week
As for 13/05/2023, we have:

> NPM weekly downloads of each package (cypress / nightwatch / playwright / selenium-webdriver), over the past year [^1] 

#### History, last 5 years

We can see in the graph below the rapid rise of the "Playwright" framework from 2020.
